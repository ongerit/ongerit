Hi, I'm Thomas, an experienced Engineering Manager with a passion for traveling ✈️ and volunteering 🙏. In addition to my professional experience leading cross-functional engineering teams, I have volunteered my time at ScriptEd to help underprivileged high school students learn coding.

When I'm not working, you can find me exploring new destinations 🌍 or planning my next adventure 🧳. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality products 🎁 on time and within budget 💰 using agile methodologies 🤝, excellent communication 🗣️ and interpersonal skills 💬, and experience building and maintaining positive team culture 🤗. 

Feel free to reach out to me at 📫 thomas@joinforma.com.
