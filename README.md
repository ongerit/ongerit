Hi, I'm Thomas, an experienced Engineering Manager with a passion for traveling and volunteering. In addition to my professional experience leading cross-functional engineering teams, I have volunteered my time at ScriptEd to help underprivileged high school students learn coding.

When I'm not working, you can find me exploring new destinations or planning my next adventure. I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality products on time and within budget using agile methodologies, excellent communication and interpersonal skills, and experience building and maintaining positive team culture. 

Feel free to reach out to me at tom@thomasongeri.com
